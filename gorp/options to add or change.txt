-g: TBD
-b: parse text in Word documents, PDFs, and Excel files. Probably make it so that the option can specify only some of those types (e.g., -bwp would search only Word and Excel docs, not PDFs).
-o (change): make it so that it returns only the matched parts of lines rather than the entire line
-q: used after a pipe. Returns the union of the results from the query up to that pipe with the query after the pipe.
-u: update all files found this way, as with sed
-x: read XML and HTML with XPath rather than using normal regexes
-z: zip all files found this way into a zip file at target filepath
